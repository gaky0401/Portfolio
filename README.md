## Portfolio (Update)

## Project Information
I created 3 web pages. A home page (index.html), a portfolio page (portfolio.html), and a contact page (contact.html).
After using bootstrap to modify columns and the layout of each page, I added css styling of my own as well. Modifying the footer and using it to add a media query as well. On all pages, there is a navbar that highlights the page that is currently active. I added notation where appropriate and kept it up to date with html5 semantics.

Update: I updated my linkedIn Profile and updated/added my github profile.
I made the site more visually appealing and added projects and homeworks to the
portfolio page. I made sure the site is running properly and tested it as well.
Portfolio is up to date!
